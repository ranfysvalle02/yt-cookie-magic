YouTube rotates cookies frequently on open YouTube browser tabs as a security measure. To export cookies that will remain working with yt-dlp, you will need to export cookies in such a way that they are never rotated.

One way to do this is through a private browsing/incognito window:

    Open a new private browsing/incognito window and log into YouTube
    Open a new tab and close the YouTube tab
    Export cookies from the browser then close the private browsing/incognito window so the session is never opened in the browser again.
